Over the last couple of years I've been expanding my Python experience by making my own maps and projets. This folder has many very old projects that are very archaic and probably don't work in Pyhton 3

My very first project was a Wheel of Fortune game I built and it was very clunky and probably considered bad programming, but I was new to both Python and computer programming in general so I made it work the best I could. One could compare it to making a car run on plumbimg parts!

I branched out to just trying new things, like one project was basically a random lat/lon locator that would bring up a Google Maps webpage if it hit in the state of Colorado. This was a very silly project but it allowed me to explore some fascinating aspects of Python libraries.

Finally, as I was starting to get into programming and atmospheric sciences the two worlds began colliding and I was getting sick of openeing a million different browser tabs to look at the different weather maps at the begiing of my day, so I built a massive Jupyter notebook that did it all essentially automatically! This lent a hand in my current exploits in Python for perosnal, academic, and even professional gain!
