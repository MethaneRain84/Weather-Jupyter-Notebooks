The purpose here was really just combating boredom and trying to learn new things in Python. 

The game simulates a "bombs" being randomly dropped in the US and seeing if any hit in Colorado, and if they did were they close to where I lived.
THe cool part I was able to integrate was if it hit anywhere in CO, a new Google Maps webpage ould pop up with that location!
