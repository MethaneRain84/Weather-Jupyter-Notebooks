I was granted a wonderful opportunity to redo Dr. Shuenemann's Atmospheric Dynamics IDL lab into Python.

There are plenty of things that could be changed:
* Missing data on plots could be resolved with assigning color ranges better
* Switch over from Basemap to CartoPy
* Have Vorticity colorbar values in 10^-5 ranges

<h2><font>For this dynamics lab, the date chosen for the case study was February 1-3rd of 2016; Denver's Groundhog Day Storm. </font></h2>

<h3><font>The setup for Denver's storm was a classic Low pressure center around Southeast Colorado bringing upslope flow and vertical motions.</font></h3>

<h3><font>The students were assigned a lab as part of their final grade to read in raw data and manipulate it to get atmospheric variables for plotting.

They made functions for:
* Coriolis Parameter 
* Pressure Gradient Force
* Geostrophic Winds
* Absolute Vorticity
</font></h3>

<h3><font>

Variables Used:
* Geopotential Heights
* Latitude/Longitudes 
</font></h3>
