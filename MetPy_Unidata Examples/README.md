Thanks to the hard work over at Unidata, the devs have made some amazing examples and I have been able to utilize thier examples and sort of customize them for my own daily maps.

I made all the examples run in similar fashions and all have the exact latitude/longitude extents and map projection so all can easily be comparable when looking at several maps.
