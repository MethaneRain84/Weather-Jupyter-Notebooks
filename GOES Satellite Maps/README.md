A lot of external work from some very talented people (I have tried to give all credit where credit is due on the various pieces) plus a lot of my own piecing together has manifested into plotting of GOES 16 and 17 satellite images for: 

* Visible - ch 2
* Water Vapor - ch 9
* Infrared - ch 13
* Psuedo True Color: R (ch 2), G (ch 3), B (ch 1)
* GOES Lightning Mapper

There are still some things that need to be worked out and clarified in the code. One major hiccup I have with plotting GOES-16 data in my Lambert Conformal projection is a slight misalignment of data and map on the west coast. See the issues/problems folder.
