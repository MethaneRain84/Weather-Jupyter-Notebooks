As a way for me to try and easliy pull the maps from the differetn agencys webpages, I figured an automated Python script could help eliminate the time it took me to look up the various maps I had bookmarked. 

The code is very robust, most of the time went into actually hard coding the web address and file name I was going to call the saved image.
